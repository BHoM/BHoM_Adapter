# Core BHoM_Adapter Repo

This repo is part of the Buildings and Habitats object Model. 
If you are new (_welcome!_  ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜„)  a great place to start is on [bhom.xyz](https://bhom.xyz) and reading our [documentation](https://bhom.xyz/documentation), including our [Getting Started Pages](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/Basics/Using-the-BHoM/).

This particular repo contains the parent _BHoM Adapter_ defining all the base functionality for interoperability between the BHoM and other software, platforms and environments.

The BHoM Adapter provides a framework to "Push" and "Pull" (or import and export) data between different applications. This includes organising explicit converts between any other language or object representation and the BHoM. See [introduction to the base adpater](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/Introduction-to-the-BHoM_Adapter) for more details.


Along with the rest of the core repositories - [BHoM](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM), [BHoM_Engine](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_Engine) and [BHoM_UI](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_UI) â€“ this is the basis on which all of the BHoM Toolkits are built.

## Quick Start ðŸš€ 

Grab the [latest installer](https://bhom.xyz/) and a selection of [sample scripts](https://github.com/BHoM/samples).


## Getting Started for Developers ðŸ¤– 

If you want to build the BHoM and the Toolkits from source, it's hopefully easy! ðŸ˜„ 
Do take a look at our specific wiki pages here: [Getting Started for Developers](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/Guides-and-Tutorials/Coding-with-BHoM/).
